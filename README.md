### ABOUT ME ☂️.

ೃ⁀➷ __You may call me NOIR... However, Finality is also a good choice.__ ⋆·˚ ༘ *

*ੈ✩‧₊˚ __I'm a very friendly and chatty person, mostly open to any type of friendships. I don't really care for problems that aren't mine, so, don't drag drama over me and my friends. If you're gonna do that, just don't interact at all.__ ⋆.ೃ࿔*:･

⋆·˚ ༘ * __Kevin Kaslana__ *and* __Otto Apocalypse__ are my favorite characters, and I may do act like them a little bit. **However** that does not mean that I'm entirely like them, so don't go straight judging by that. ˏˋ°•*⁀➷

⍣ ೋ *The world is at **chaos** , it is neither **fair** nor **sensible**. It wrong **heroes** and breeds **scum**. It is rife with ugliness without a trace of **beauty**.* ‗ ❍

Aether Gazer, **Honkai Impact 3rd**, Honkai: Star Rail, **ARKNIGHTS**, Yume Nikki & a lot more. Just ask me, I'll probably know or whatever.
ੈ✩‧₊˚ __Please interact if you really like HONKAI or any of the games above. Either way, I love chatting aswell, so, if you want someone to talk with, just poke me or something. I'll gladly entertain you somehow.__ ✧.*

Doesn't have any at all, just don't bother me and we're good. I may look a little __intimidating__ but I promise I'm a good person. Either way, I don't bite, feel free to __INT__. I may be a little energetic too, so keep that in mind, the "cool" facade is just for fancies in the end. __Personally__, I don't like the __Okegom__ fandom. __Skins__ are __fine__, __fandom__ is __not__.

˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ **Cuddle + Hide is fine, aslong I'm not with anyone. If I am, ask them first, not me.** ~ **I'm a very straightforward person, so please, be honest with me, if I'm bothering you or not. It will be better for both of us, so I'll know how to manage better.** ┊͙ ˘͈ᵕ˘͈
