## ——— ABOUT ME ——— ☂️

ೃ ___You can call me **Venus**... or **Noir**. Whichever suits the mood. I respond to both, eventually.___ ⋆·˚ 

*₊˚ * _I’m pretty easy-going, really. I’m friendly!! Promise I don’t bite. So if you ever feel like interacting, go ahead. I probably won’t have the energy to start something myself, but… you’re welcome to. Energy isn’t exactly something I have in abundance. That said, there are... rare exceptions. When I’m with someone dear to me? It’s like I temporarily download a new personality patch._ ₊˚

─ _“ It's [you](https://github.com/CiviIizations) and **me**. ” ✦_

### ﹤OVERALL + BYI & DNI﹥
— ⚙️ ,, *_There are a lot of games I enjoy, and more anime than I can count that I’m completely obsessed with. If you ever catch me cosplaying a character from a fandom... chances are, I’m already deep in it. Just ask; it’s not that hard to figure out... Oh by the way, don't depend on me for time stuff. Yeah... let’s just say I don’t really keep track of it very well. I blink, and suddenly it’s 3AM. Timekeeper irony, I know._*

— ⌛ ,, *_I’m a pretty introverted person, to be honest. I don’t really talk much, listening is more my thing. I like the quiet... it’s where I feel most like myself. But hey, despite that, I promise I’m not that bad to be around. I like to think I have a solid personality... give or take a few existential crises. So if you’re okay with a little silence, I think we’ll get along just fine._*

—⚠️ ,, _Basic DNI Criteria and that's pretty much it... for the rest, I **hide + block freely**._

### ﹤ DAYDREAM — ENDING ﹥

🌨️ ,, **" No matter what has happened, no matter what you've done, no matter what you do... I will always love [you](https://github.com/CiviIizations). I swear it."** _You’ll probably notice I mention her a lot. If you ever come across her through my GitHub, I just ask that you treat her kindly—and gently. She’s incredibly sweet... thoughtful in ways most people don’t notice at first. The kind of person you’re lucky to have around. So please, be good to her._

,,


🔎 ,, *_If something ever happens between you and a friend of mine, I kindly ask that you handle it directly with them. I may know them, but your conflict isn’t mine to manage. I’m not the middle ground, nor the messenger. I understand if you're upset or feel the need to vent, but I’m not the right person for that. I tend to keep to myself for a reason... peace is a luxury I’d like to keep. Please don’t pull me or anyone else into drama. I’d rather remain on the sidelines, quietly watching the timeline unfold... from a distance. Thanks._*

⏰ _Cuddle + Hide are fine by me… unless I’m with my [beloved](ttps://github.com/CiviIizations). She comes first, always. She’s the one who really looks after my comfort, so if you're thinking of joining a potential cuddle pile, you might want to ask her first. If she’s okay with it, I won’t complain. Also, just a heads-up: I tend to go non-verbal a lot. If I suddenly go quiet, it’s not you. I probably just ran out of words for the day. It happens. Time's weird like that._
