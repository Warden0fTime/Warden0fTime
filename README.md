## ——— ABOUT ME ——— ☂️

ೃ _You can call me __**Venus**__ or __**Noir**__... or whatever floats your boat. You can call me clock woman for what I care lmfao_ ⋆·˚ 

*₊˚ _I'm really easy-going and most of the time really friendly, I do not bite; feel free to interact with me if you want or wish to. Although, keep in mind that energy is something I often don't have... exceptions are made when I'm with my dearest. Just not really confident on myself, the only moment I ever gain a grain of confidence or related; it's when I'm with [her](https://github.com/CiviIizations)._ ⋆*:

─ _“ It's [you](https://github.com/CiviIizations) and **me**. ” ✦_

### ﹤OVERALL + BYI & DNI﹥
— ⚙️ ,, _There's a lot of games that I like, lots of animes that I'm absolutely in-love with. Just ask me, if you see me using a certain cosplay of some certain character of a fandom, it's very likely that I'm a member myself. Give it a shot, not too hard. For music taste; I listen to anything that sounds nice I guess._

— ⌛ ,, _I'm a **very introverted** person and tend not to be very verbal. I enjoy a lot a **mutual-silence and short-talks from time to time**; I can and will have **sudden mood changes depending on the day or whatever is going on with my life**. One thing to **keep in mind** is that I often **match your energy**, whenether that's a good or bad thing it **depends entirely on you**. If you're looking for a friend who's usually just on their own n'will listen to you whenever you need that someone, I'll gladly say that I'm exactly that type of friend. **Keep in mind** that I also **do not sugarcoat stuff**, I **hate dishonesty** and I'll be **very much sincere** regardless of what's the topic, if you cannot take that; **don't even bother** asking for my opinion._

—⚠️ ,, _Basic DNI Criteria and that's pretty much it... for the rest, I **hide + block freely**. Just don't be a jerk and we'll be fine._

### ﹤ DAYDREAM — ENDING ﹥

🌨️ ,, **" No matter what has happened, no matter what you've done, no matter what you do... I will always love [you](https://github.com/CiviIizations). I swear it."** Sometimes it feels like I'm dreaming due to ending up with someone so amazing as her. As for you, reader; please let me have my moment. My entire personality is based on loving my [girlfriend](https://github.com/CiviIizations)... please be nice n'thoughtful with her, she's still very much soft n'delicate!!/gen

🔎 ,, _If you ever find yourself having any type of problem or conflict with a **friend** of mine I'd like to kindly remind you that it's between **YOU** and **THEM**. Do not involve me in your conflict, I might be their friend but I am not associated with your conflict or whatever may be going on. While I understand you may be **frustrated** or **bothered**, I'm not the right person to approach; you can solve it yourself. One other thing I'd like to ask is to not involve me or anyone in any type of drama; I'm a really isolated person and don't really want to deal with that kind of stuff. Thank you._

⏰ _**Cuddle** + **Hide** is fine unless I'm with my [beloved](https://github.com/CiviIizations). She comes first and always will, prioritizing my comfort the most after all. ._
