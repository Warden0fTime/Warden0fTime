## ——— ABOUT ME ——— ☂️

ೃ⁀➷ _You may call me ***Venus*** or ***Noir***._ ⋆·˚ ༘ *

*ੈ✩‧₊˚ __I tend to be really friendly and easy-going. I'm also a very understanding person, if you ever have a problem with me, we can always talk about it.__ ⋆.ೃ࿔*:･

── _The world is at **chaos**, it is neither **fair** nor **sensible**. It wrong **heroes** and breeds **scum**. It is a rife with ugliness without a trace of **beauty**._ ✦

—— 💎 _**I am a very introverted person and tend not to be social in the slightest. Please expect some awkwardness the first time you talk to me, as I'm not used to new people talking to me. Don't let that demotivate you though; you can approach me and have a chat, I personally don't mind it at all, I'm just a bit socially awkward.**_ ⚙️

⚠️ _Basic **DNI** Criteria._

🔎 _If you ever have any problems with a friend of mine, I'd like to **kindly** remind you that it's between **YOU** and **THEM**. I have nothing to do with your tea, so don't drag your little show around me. I **despise** arguments and discussions, even more when it involves any friend of mine. While I understand you might be **"angry"** or **"annoyed"**, I'm not the right person to approach. You can solve it yourself._

⏰ _**Cuddle** + **Hide** it's fine but when I'm around my friends please ask them instead. ._
