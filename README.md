## — Warden of Time 

ೃ __You can call me **Venus**... or **Maelis**. Whichever suits the mood. I respond to both, eventually.__ ⋆·˚ 

*₊˚ * _I’m pretty easy-going, really. I’m friendly!! I promise I don’t bite. So if you ever feel like interacting, go ahead. I probably won’t have the energy to start something myself, but… you’re welcome to. Energy isn’t exactly something I have in abundance._ ₊˚

─ _“ It's [you](https://github.com/CiviIizations) and **me**. ” ✦_

### ﹤ ^-^ ﹥
— ⚙️ ,, *_Project Sekai, HoloLive, Limbus Company, Roblox, Muse Dash, Touhou, VRChat, Library of Ruina, Omori, UmaMusume... those are one of many of my interests, you can ask me for more._*

— ⌛ ,, *_I’m a pretty introverted person, to be honest. I don’t really talk much, listening is more my thing. I like the quiet... it’s where I feel most like myself. But hey, despite that, I promise I’m not that bad to be around. I like to think I have a solid personality... give or take a few existential crises. So if you’re okay with a little silence, I think we’ll get along just fine._*

—⚠️ ,, _I **BLOCK** + **HIDE** freely, specially if you're covering me in any way; not limited to spamming or such._

### < ENDING ﹥

⏰ _**Cuddle + Hide** are fine by me… unless I’m with my [beloved](ttps://github.com/CiviIizations). She comes first, always. She’s the one who really looks after my comfort, so if you're thinking of joining a potential cuddle pile, you might want to ask her first. If she’s okay with it, I won’t complain. Also, just a heads-up: I tend to go non-verbal a lot. If I suddenly go quiet, it’s **not you**. I probably just ran out of words for the day. It happens. **Time's** weird like that._
